Below is just to summarise problem types seem by me while working on this topic. Posting here so that , it can help people to get feel of overall DP problem categories. BTW, these are just my personal notes, where I have also provided reference link from Tushar Roy video which help with concepts. And definately if you all problems mentioned below - you will get fairly good idea and thought process behind Dynamic programming.
